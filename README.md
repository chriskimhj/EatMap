# EatMap
This repository holds the source code for the EatMap web application. EatMap was developed to help users decide on where to go for their next meal within Calgary. The app allows users to browse through a selection of restaurants and food spots within Calgary. Each spot has a rating, description, some pictures, and a map link to that location. This project was intended to showcase early web development skills using Express and Node.js.
